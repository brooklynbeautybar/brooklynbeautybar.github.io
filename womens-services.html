						<h3>EYEBROW WAXING</h3>
                            <p>Our Brisbane Brow waxing treatment starts off with a one on one, informative brow consult determining what shape will complement your unique features and frame your face.<br>
                            This is followed by detailed brow sculpting to ensure your eyebrow shape is perfectly tailored to you.<br>
                            Let us create the ideal shape for you at Brisbanes best brow salon.</p><br>
						<h3>EYEBROW THREADING</h3>
                            <p>Eyebrow threading is a more gentle form of hair removal for your skin.<br>
                            As more and more people are using AHA’s in their skin care, the area around the brow can become quite sensitive to waxing.<br>
                            Eyebrow threading is a great alternative.<br>
                            With the added benefits of accuracy, our experienced artists offer the best eyebrow threading in Brisbane.</p><br><br>
						<h3>EYEBROW TINTING</h3>
                            <p>Whether your brows are light to medium in colour or contain those “naughty blondes”, eyebrow tinting works for everyone. At its core, brow tint is applied to your eyebrows to accentuate the shape and create a fuller look.<br>
                            Brow tinting can also be highly effective in bringing out the colour of your eyes as well as complementing your hair and skin tones. Our experts can analyse your features for your perfect brow lightening or darkening colour.</p><br>
						<h3>ADVANCED BROW SERVICES</h3>
                            <p>Ask one of our consultants about our advanced eyebrow treatments including:<br><br>
                            - Eyebrow Lightening<br>
                            - Eyebrow Extensions<br>
                            - Eyebrow Tattooing (feather touch brows or shading)<br><br>
                            Eyebrow Tattooing is offered through the<br> <b>Brooklyn Cosmetic Clinic.</b></p>

						<h3>DERMAL COCKTAILS</h3>
                            <p>A revolutionary treatment of skin-needling combined with highly concentrated serums, deeply penetrated into the skin for next level skin care results.<br>
                            Choose from six dermal cocktails, each containing its own skin care superpower.<br>
                            Fighting a wide range of skin conditions with skin-needling allows the complex serums to more effectively penetrate the skin, giving you intensified results.</p><br>
						<h3>HERBAL AKTIV PEEL®</h3>
                            <p>Herbal Aktiv Peel® is a plant-based corrective skin resurfacing treatment that supports and promotes the skins natural regenerative processes.<br> It's designed to compress the process of skin renewal into 5 days, visibly improving the appearance of a host of skin conditions.<br>
                            The skins barrier is never compromised or exposed to microbial infection, resulting in minimal trauma and a very safe procedure.
                            This medically proven formula contains no synthetic chemicals or acids and is suitable for most skin types and conditions.</p>

						<h3>EYELASH LIFTING</h3>

                            This method of applying 3 or more extremely thin, soft, light and high quality eyelash extensions onto one natural eyelash is unique and will ensure that your natural eyelashes stay healthy as well as dramatic and full volumed.</p><br>

Great for swimmers, holidaying and anyone with limited time in the morning. Book your lash tint with Brooklyn Beauty Bar today!</p>
